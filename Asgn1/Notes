Notes
  SBIR assumes that certain things are intuitively obvious
  2 data types
    strings and real numbers
    Strings: print statements
      no such variables
    All var are real numbers;


Operations:
  Reads in from a file specified in argument list
    no options
    assume all arguments in list are files to be read
  stores data into a list
  interpret representation
    numbers are read from stdin
    results printed to stdout
    error to stderr
      any error will force program to exit(1)
