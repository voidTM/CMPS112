smalltalk is an interpreted language

the object that recieves the command comes first apply the right side to the left side
	messages are executed from left to right
		parenthesized first
		unary->binary->keyword

run using gst -f hzip.st

3 kinds of messages
unary : single worded message
binary: message that consist of special characters
