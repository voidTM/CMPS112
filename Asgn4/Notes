1 degree = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 secs

Flight speed is constant 500mph
use havesine formula to calculate distance


Halfsing formula given lon1 lat1 lon2 lat2 dist
dlon = lon2 - lon1
dlat = lat2 - lat1
a = (sin(dlat/2))^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * (sin(dlon/2))^2
c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a))
d = R * c


arrival time = departure time + travel time
travel time = distance / 500
