This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Sam Song (sasong@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Edward Nguyen (ejnguyen@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming 
pair should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair
is working together, and at most 25% of an 
individual's effort for an assignment should be 
spent working alone. 

Sam Song spent 1 hour working alone.
Edward Nguyen spent 1 hour working alone.
We spent            10 hours working together.
Sam Song spend 5 hours driving.
Edward Nguyen spent 5 hours driving.
