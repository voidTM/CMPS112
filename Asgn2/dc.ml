* This file is useless for compilation.  However, for interactive
* testing it make loading all three files easier.  Normally for
* interactive use, type
*
*    #use "dc.ml";;
*
* at the toplevel.  Alternately, to run it directly without
* interacting with the toplevel, just use:
*
*    ocaml dc.ml
*
* which will run the program without need for compilation.
