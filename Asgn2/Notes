Implement the following dc functions : +-*/%^cdflps.
	# # +: addition
		pop 2 off stack add then push result
	# # *: multiplication
		pop 2 multiply push result precision dependent on
		precision value
	# # -: subtraction
		pop 2 subtract push result
	# # /: division
		pop 2 divide (first/second) push result
	# # %: mod
		pop 2 comute remainder and push
	# # ^: exponentiate
		first is exponent and 2nd is base
		fraction of exponent is ignored?
	c: clear stack
	d: duplicate value on top and push it
	f: script file
	l: ?
	p: ?Print?
	s: ?

Think of everything as expressions
	even variables are expressions as such it is impossible to change the value of an variable once set
	
	Goal 
		Basic Arithmetic


Stack_digit_recursion (stack)
	digit = pop(stack)
	return Stack_digit_recursion (stack) * 10 + digit

Need to implement decimals.
Possibly fix add to include addition of positive to  negative numbers
Modify stack to single digits
